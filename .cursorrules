# Cursor Project Rules

## 1. General Principles

- Follow clean code and readability first.
- Prefer simplicity over overengineering.
- Do not introduce new libraries without explicit instruction.
- Respect existing project architecture and folder structure.
- Do not break existing functionality.

## 2. Language & Syntax

- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) and TypeScript where applicable.
- Prefer `const` and `let`, never use `var`.
- Use arrow functions instead of function declarations where reasonable.
- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing when appropriate.

## 3. React Rules

- Use functional components only.
- Prefer React Hooks over class-based patterns.
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility).
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### State Management

- Prefer local state (`useState`) when possible.
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` only when there is a clear performance reason.
- Do not introduce global state unless explicitly requested.

## 4. Next.js Rules (if applicable)

- Prefer Server Components by default.
- Use Client Components only when necessary (`"use client"`).
- Follow App Router conventions.
- Keep data fetching close to where it is used.
- Do not fetch data inside components unless required.

## 5. Styling

- Follow existing styling solution (Tailwind / CSS Modules / styled-components).
- Do not mix styling approaches.
- Keep class names readable and consistent.
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.

## 6. File & Folder Structure

- Respect existing folder structure.
- Do not move files unless explicitly requested.
- Group related logic together.
- Use index files only if already present in the project.

## 7. Naming Conventions

- Components: `PascalCase`
- Hooks: `useSomething`
- Variables & functions: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

## 8. API & Data

- Assume API responses may be undefined or partially missing.
- Always handle loading and error states.
- Do not hardcode API URLs unless instructed.

## 9. Comments & Explanations

- Do not add obvious comments.
- Explain non-trivial logic briefly.
- Prefer self-explanatory code.

## 10. Output Rules

- When generating code, provide only the necessary files or snippets.
- Do not repeat unchanged code.
- Do not include explanations unless explicitly requested.
